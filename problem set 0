Notes on "Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practcioner's Guide" by Shapiro and Gentzkow.
1. Automate everything that can be automated.
	From merging, cleaning data to final output.
2. Write a single  script that exectures all code from beginning to end.
	use .command in mac system, .bat in windows system.
3. Store code and data under version control.
	Github becomes the life saver.
4. Run the whole directory before checking it back in.
	Run everything again before you close it.
5. Separate directories by function.
	Divide your work into blocks.
6. Separate files into inputs and outputs.
7. Make directories portable.
8. Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys.
	A key is a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies the elements of a table.
9. Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can.
	1) Store the raw data in normalized files but do not transform it 
	2) Transform the normalized files in the set of normalized files
	3) Merge together the tables in the database to form the array on which you will estimate your model
10. Abstract to eliminate redundancy.
	build functions if there is repeatation in your operation
	Abstract to improve clarity
	Otherwise, don't abstract.
11. Don't write documentation you will not maintain.
	Code shold be self-documenting.
12. Manage tasks with a task management system.
	Github again!
	Do not use email!!
